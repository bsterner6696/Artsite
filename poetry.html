					<p>I really enjoy writing poetry.  It serves as a healthy way to vent emotions and deal with the issues bothering me.  When I write poetry I prefer to write in free verse.  I feel that poetry is more honest when it is not constrained by the rules of other formats.  Although, I believe that certain forms of poetry, such as haiku, can be excellent tools for improving as a writer.  Poetry works best when it can force as much impact into as few words as possible.  A form that requires a very small amount of syllables is excellent practice for honing this skill.  I also keep a <a href="https://www.heraclesblanketfort.tumblr.com">tumblr blog</a> which I write on.  Although I generally look down upon tumblr as a website, I do like it as a quick platform for posting short writings.  My examples below were screenshotted from it.</p>
